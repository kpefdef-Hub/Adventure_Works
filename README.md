Insights:
•	Customers with a bachelor’s degree contribute the most to the Profit and Revenue of Adventure works. 34% of both the profit and revenue comes from customers with a bachelor’s degree
•	This is closely followed by customers with a Partial College participation. These contribute roughly 26% to the profit and revenue
•	However, when the average contribution is analyzed, we see that customers with a Graduate degree have the highest average per customer to the Profit ($790) and Revenue($1,940)
•	Customers with a High school degree with $766.5 and $1,900 have the second highest average Profit and Revenue respectively
•	Therefore, in the event of a marketing campaign, I advise that focus be on customers with a Graduate degree. This educational group offers the company a greater chance of expansion and profitability
